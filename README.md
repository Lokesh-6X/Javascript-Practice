# 🚀 JavaScript Progress Tracker

This repo is where I keep all my **JavaScript practice code**.  
Everything I learn, try out, or build while practicing JS goes here — basics, challenges, and small projects.  
The goal is simple: **commit consistently and track progress**.

---

## 🎯 Goals

- Practice core JavaScript concepts.
- Build a habit of coding daily.
- Push commits to track growth.
- Work on mini projects for hands-on learning.


## 📝 Notes

- Some code might be messy — it’s practice, not production.
- I’ll keep adding more as I move forward.
- Projects are small but help me apply what I learn.
